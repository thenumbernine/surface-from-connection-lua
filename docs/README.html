This is WIP project.<br>
<br>
Lots of NR codes operate on a (rectangular?) grid<br>
and likewise they keep track of only the metric and coordinate information<br>
with no information about the background coordinate system.<br>
<br>
This is an attempt to reconstruct the surface of the coordinate space using only the numerical metric information.<br>
I am integrating the basis vectors using the connection coefficients, and integrating the points in background coordinate space using the basis vectors.<br>
<br>
I've tried <br>
<ul>
<li>forward-Euler integration</li>
<li>RK4 integration</li>
<li>explicitly solving linear dynamic systems (assuming the connection is constant), which I only have available for certain classifications of matrices.</li>
</ul>
I am testing it against known metrics.<br>
Right now just the polar metric.<br>
<br>
Here's the difference in error between the analytical connection and the numerically computed connection:<br>

<br>
So far I can reconstruct any surface with no extrinsic curvature, provided the correct initial coordinates and basis are provided.<br>
<br>
For reconstructing the holonomic polar coordinates starting at ${e_a}^I(x_0) = \delta_a^I$ and $x_0 = [ r_0, \theta_0 ] = [0,1]$ we get things that work out:<br>

<br>
If the initial coordinates are chosen to be $r_0 = 2$ then we get the following:<br>
<br>

<br>
...and if the initial coordinates are chosen to be $r_0 = \frac{1}{2}$ then we get this:<br>
<br>
<img src='polar-incorrect-r=.5.png'/><br>
<br>
TODO show the math that verifies this<br>
